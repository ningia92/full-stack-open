# [Part 3 - Programming a server with NodeJS and Express](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3)

**NB**: in this part of the course it was recommended to complete all the exercises of part 3 in a new repository (and to place the source code directly in the root of the repository), so as not to have problems with the deployment in Render. The repository is located [here](https://github.com/ningia92/phonebook-backend.git)

In this part our focus shifts towards the backend, that is, towards implementing functionality on the server side of the stack. We will implement a simple REST API in Node.js by using the Express library, and the application's data will be stored in a MongoDB database. At the end of this part, we will deploy our application to the internet.

## Modules

a. Node.js and Express  
b. Deploying app to internet  
c. Saving data to MongoDB  
d. Validation and ESLint
