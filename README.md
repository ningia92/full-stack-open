***This repository will contain all my solutions to the exercises encountered during the course, divided into directories for each part.***

### Course summary

The content of the course is the same as in the [Full stack course](https://fullstackopen.com/) held at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/faculty-science/faculty/computer-science) at the University of Helsinki in Spring 2023.

This course is an introduction to modern web development with JavaScript. The main focus is on single-page applications implemented with React and supporting them with RESTful and GraphQL web services implemented with Node.js. The course also has parts on TypeScript, React Native, and Continuous integration.

Other topics include debugging applications, container technology, configuration, managing runtime environments, and databases.
